# Canvas-patterns
Canvas is a great tool to create cool patterns , animations and many more.
So, this project uses basic html and css code and mostly used javascript.
I have used basic canvas out of my knowledge. You can alter the JS to create different patterns.
Here are few types of patterns from this project.Feel free to use the code and try out your own patterns.
